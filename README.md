# NYC_Citibike_Analysis

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of the following analysis was to investigate Citi Bike (New York City bike share program) data using visualization techniques held within Tableau. Specifically, the analysis looked at ride duration by gender, daily ride behavior by gender and the most common pick-up and drop-off locations for riders.

The goal was to create a compelling visual story which can effectively describe to the audience what the Cibi Bike rider behavior is like in New York City.

## Procedure

2) Using Python, create a Data Frame and convert the "tripduration" column into the ```datetime``` format so that it can be used for the Tableau analysis
3) Create 7 chartes to be used in the Citi Bike analysis
    -  Trip duration chart which shows number of rides by their trip duration in bins of 1 hour.
